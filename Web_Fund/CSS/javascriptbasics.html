                <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        Variable Declaration JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;
                        </ul>
                        <ul>Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x= 10;</ul>
                        <ul>Data Types Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean, - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!;" Array - [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</ul>
                        <ul>Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</ul>
                        <ul>Loops There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</ul>
                        <ul>Functions Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done! We finished out instructions. Sadly there a a ton more table to do so lets call our function over and over again.</ul>
