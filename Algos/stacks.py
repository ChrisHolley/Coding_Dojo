we can use a SSL as a stack
Insert into a stack (push_ is the same as adding to the front of a SLL
remobing from a stat(pop) is the same as removing from the front of a SSLthe gola is to use what we know about sll to build a stack with the following methons)

class SLNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.value = val
        self.next = None
class Stack:
    def __init__(Self):
        self.head = None

# challenge for you guys
    def Push(self, val):
        #this code should handle pushing into a stack
        if self.head == None:
    def Pop(self):
        #this code should handle removing from a stack
        pass
    def Peek(self):
        #this code should handle showing what is at the top of a stack
        pass
